Once clicked the button will shrink and grow accordingly to simulate a physical action of pressing a button.
Of course, after that the player is transferred to the main screen of the game.

**Explanation:** This is the main screen of the game - where all the core processes take place:

* The player's goal is to reach his love which is at the top of the maze.
* The player has to move through the maze by half of the keyboard and find the way that will allow him to reach it.
 *The player has to watch out for the robbers who travel along the maze in different locations and at different speeds.
* If the player is caught by the bandit they lose and are taken to the loss screen.
* If the player managed to reach his love without being caught by the robbers, he won the game and is transferred to the victory page.
